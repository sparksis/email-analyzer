# Architectural Goals

This document outlines the architectural goals for the email analyzer application. These goals ensure that the application is designed and built to meet the desired quality attributes and requirements.

## Modularity

- The application should be designed with a modular architecture to promote separation of concerns and reusability of components.
- Each module should have a well-defined interface and should be loosely coupled with other modules.
- The application should use modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries to implement modularity, such as React for the user interface and Dexie.js for the local database.

## Scalability

- The application should be designed to efficiently handle a large volume of email metadata for a single user, ensuring performance does not significantly degrade as the number of analyzed emails increases.
- The architecture should support efficient local data processing and storage, accommodating future enhancements and features related to email analysis.

## Performance

- The application should be optimized for performance to ensure fast loading times and smooth user interactions.
- The application should use efficient algorithms and data structures to minimize memory and CPU usage.
- The application should leverage browser caching and local storage to reduce network requests and improve performance.

## Security

- The application should follow best practices for security to protect user data and privacy.
- The application should use OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization to access the user's Gmail account.
- The application should use HTTPS for all network communication to ensure data privacy and integrity.
- The application should not store any sensitive user data on the server. All data should be stored locally on the user's device.

## Usability

- The application should have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and understand.
- The application should provide clear and concise error messages to help users troubleshoot issues.
- The application should be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Maintainability

- The application should follow best practices for code organization and documentation to make it easy to maintain and extend.
- The application should have a comprehensive test suite to ensure that changes do not introduce new bugs.
- The application should use version control to track changes and facilitate collaboration among developers.

## Reliability

- The application should be able to recover gracefully from errors and continue functioning without data loss.
- The application should have a robust error handling mechanism to catch and log errors for debugging purposes.
- The application should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly under various conditions and edge cases.

## Compatibility

- The application should be compatible with the latest versions of major web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- The application should work well on different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Accessibility

- The application should follow accessibility guidelines to ensure that it is usable by people with disabilities.
- The application should provide keyboard navigation and screen reader support for users with visual impairments.
- The application should use appropriate color contrast and font sizes to ensure readability for all users.
